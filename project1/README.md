# Movie Trailer Website (Project 1)

### Information

Movie Trailer Website is the first project from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. It is a simple website that showcases a few of my favorite movies, allowing the user to click on the poster to show the trailer.

### Instructions

With python installed, run:

```
python entertainment_center.py
```

This will create an html file called `fresh_tomatoes.html` and load the file in your default web browser.
